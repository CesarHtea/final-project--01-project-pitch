# Final Project Pitch

Your final project is a demonstration of your knowledge and will be a showpiece in your portfolio. You will have two weeks to complete the project and you will be responsible for each phase from concept to design to development.

The best way to frame your project is from a potential user's point of view:

  - what problem does your project solve
  - how will users benefit from using your application.

To start, we will begin with the following exercise so that you can begin to form ideas and scope the work.

### Project Pitch Exercise

**Summary**

A one or two sentence synopsis of what your idea is.

**Audience**

**Benefits**

What benefits does your user get out of your application? Or alternatively, what problem is solved?

**Features**

What the application _does_. Note that this is different than the benefits.

**Technology**

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you need for your project
